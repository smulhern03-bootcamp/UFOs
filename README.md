# UFOs
## Overview
The following product was generated at owner's request.  The owner wished to have better data filtering capabilities by having multiple filtering fields available.  Users now have the ability to filter data based upon five criteria instead of one.

## Results
The website now provides a simply, yet powerful filter for the UFO data provided in the website.  There are now five levels of data filter instead on one filter.

Additionally, by entering a desired filter and hitting the "Tab" button, the data will automatically filter as filters are added.

Data can reliably be filtered needing only two filters.  The more broad a filter, the more likely desireable results will be found.

## Summary
### Drawback
Without prior knowledge, the user may not know the depth of data available.  Does the user know a timeframe? Do they know the city?  Because the variables are limited for the data (which allows greater accessibility to users by decreasing complexity), if the user also doesn't have an idea of what they are looking for, limited information is available.
### Recommendations
1. Put the filter on a separate webpage.  The current webpage has a lot of content to then have large filter entries appear at the bottom.  A different page would make it cleaner.
2. Have drop-down menus with the available information.  This would prevent users from spending time trying to find data that doesn't exist.  If there is no data for Minnesota, don't allow the user to enter it into the filter.
